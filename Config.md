# git config

When first setting up git, you'll need to work with git config commands in order to set up your identity.

For example, your identity can be set up with the commands such as:

```
git config --global user.name "Becky Wright"
git config --global user.email bwright9902@gmail.com
```

For more information, view the [first time git setup](https://git-scm/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) documentation.
